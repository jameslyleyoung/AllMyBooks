# AllMyBooks

[Link to Live Project]()

## Summary of Project 

A simple book scanning and logging website/app.


## Why I am making this project and the problem I am solving

I was gifted a large number of books recently after a friend of mine passed.
I would love to read all of them, in order to get a better idea of who he was-if that's even possible;
however, space and time are not at limitless as we would like to believe in our small cone of the universe.
So, I'm hoping to make this website/app capable of looking up books online easily-from a scanner on my smartphone,
to put them in a list, to facilitate selling and or donating them.

## Skills

I would like to make this a Cross Platform Smartphone App on Android, Apple and Windows, using Xamarin-eventually.
Visual Studio Community Edition
C# and the ASP.Net Core MVC frameworks
SQL Server Database


## Features

* Add and Edit, as well as Display a paginated list of your books.
* Sort Books, by Author and/or Title, other props???
* Books can be added manually by typing in the ISBN, or hopefully-automatically by scanning the barcode.

## Screen Captures
